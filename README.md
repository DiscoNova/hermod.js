# Hermod

## What is it?

Hermod has been a "free-time project" I started back in the early 2000s. It was initially meant to be an "event-based inter- and intra-application messaging API" ... at the time mostly meant for "JavaScript-driven webapps" and basically built for little more than my own personal use. Now (in 2020) I have chosen to release it in order to not re-invent the wheel (again).

## Why "Hermod"?

The name of the application is based on an even earlier project of mine, the "Hermod-message filter" (which was an offspring of the [PSFPOP3](https://www.disconova.com/utu/psfpop3/) SPAM-filter) and was named as they were because at the time most - if not all - of my personal projects (such as: Dvalin; the plugin that created various forged binary formats of the time based on some superfluous metadata available, Mímir (the brain literally bridging various things together - and still "unveiled for the users"), etc.) were named based on various characters derived from Norse mythology. "Hermóðr", anglicized as "Hermod", is often considered "the messenger of the gods"; and is a norse version of Hermes, the greek "herald of the gods", if you wish.
